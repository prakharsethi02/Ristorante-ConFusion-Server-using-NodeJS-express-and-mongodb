# HTTP Server

This folder contain files that implement simple HTTP server that returns html files from a folder.

## Development Server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to ` http://localhost:3000` to see the result. For this I used Google Chrome app for interacting with HTTP APIs called POSTMAN.
