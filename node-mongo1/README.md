# Web Server using Express Framework and Express Router to support REST API

The folder contains the files that implements a simple web server using Express framework that in turn serves static content.

## Development server

Run `npm start` to start web server. I have used `Morgan` a HTTP request logger middleware for serving static files.

## Routes Folder

The folder contains the files that used express router in express framework to support `REST AI`. <br>
`index.js` contains a REST API to support the application.
